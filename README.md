# gRPC Python Examples
gRPC Python examples as reference code from a talk: Building Python services through gRPC.

Slides are available at Speakerdeck: [Building Python services through gRPC](https://speakerdeck.com/pantuza/building-python-services-through-grpc)


In this project there is three directories with three examples:

1. [A very simple gRPC service](https://github.com/pantuza/grpc-python-examples/blob/master/cheese-farm/Readme.md)
2. [A video Stream server](https://github.com/pantuza/grpc-python-examples/blob/master/soccer-match-streaming/Readme.md)
3. [A secure (TLS) service](https://github.com/pantuza/grpc-python-examples/blob/master/secure-cheese-farm/Readme.md)

The links above refers to each documentation of how to run services on your machine.
